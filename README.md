This repository contains the final assessment for the 4th quarter 
in Empowerment Technologies. This is the final task to be done 
for the subject this year and it is a website created with my 
collaborators, Rylie and Karyl. This website is for a made up makeup 
company called Blaussom Cosmetics. It's design was mostly
created by Karyl and was brought to life by the three of us 
coding it. It has custom logos and pictures as well as 7 functioning
pages, a home page, about page, reviews page, products page, and contact
us page. This website is the fruits of multiple days of labor between
us three. I hope you like our website as you browse through it.
