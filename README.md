# This is a website created with the collaboration of rylie and karyl. Our
# website is for our made up beauty brand called blaussom cosmetics. It was
# designed mostly by karyl but the coding was a team effort. This website 
# contained 7 working pages including a home page, about page, contact us page
# and pages for our products and reviewer/user feedback of the products. This
# website was made for the purpose of finishing our final task for Empowerment
# Technologies for the 11th grade. I hope you like the outcome of our website!
